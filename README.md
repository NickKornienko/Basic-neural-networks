# Basic-neural-networks
Basic neural networks using numpy, tensorflow, pytorch, and jax

All parts of the assignment are in the labeled notebooks, trying to follow the parts of the canvas assignment as much as possible:

a) b) a) safisfied by numpy_neural_network.ipynb

b) pytorch_neural_network.ipynb

c) pytorch_class_neural_network.ipynb

d) pytorch_lightning_neural_network.ipynb

e) tensorflow_neural_network.ipynb (all parts)

h) jax_neutral_network.ipynb
